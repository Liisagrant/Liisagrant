# Welcome to my GitHub page! :wave:

Hi there! My name is Lisa, and I am a 32-year-old former pre school teacher with a love for learning and a passion for all things coding. When I'm not busy teaching little ones, you can find me sipping on a steaming cup of coffee :coffee: or enjoying the great outdoors :earth_americas:.

## My Goal (so far) in 2023
This year, my goal is to create a visually appealing tic tac toe game :game_die:, and I'm excited to share my progress and learn from others on GitHub. I hope to contribute valuable projects and collaborate with a diverse community of developers. 

## Want to talk?
Feel free to take a look around and check out my projects :open_file_folder:. I'm always open to feedback and suggestions :speech_balloon:, so don't hesitate to reach out. Let's connect and create something awesome together! :rocket:
