Hi there! My name is Lisa, and I am a 32-year-old former pre school teacher with a love for learning and a passion for all things coding. When I'm not busy teaching little ones, you can find me sipping on a steaming cup of coffee :coffee: or enjoying the great outdoors :earth_americas:. 

Currently studying Frontend Development at Noroff üè´

## My Goal in 2023 :rocket:
This year, my goal is to create a visually appealing tic tac toe game :game_die: with a focus on design and functionality. The game will allow players to choose their symbol (X or O) and take turns making moves on a 3x3 grid. The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. 

I'm excited to share my progress and learn from others on GitHub. I hope to contribute valuable projects and collaborate with a diverse community of developers.
